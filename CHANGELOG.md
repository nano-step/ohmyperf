## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-19

First public release. **15 `@ohmyperf/*` packages** published to npm.

> **Scope-decision history (informational):** an interim release was briefly published as `@nhonh/*` (v0.1.0 + v0.1.1, ~30 minutes live) because the `@ohmyperf` npm organization had not yet been created. Both `@nhonh/*` versions were unpublished within the 72-hour window per npm policy; `@ohmyperf` is the canonical scope going forward. `@ohmyperf/trace-utils` (the package whose missing publish caused the @nhonh/v0.1.1 patch) ships as a public dependency from v0.1.0 of `@ohmyperf`.

### Added

- **`@ohmyperf/cli`** — CLI binary `ohmyperf` with 8 subcommands (`run`, `diff`, `share`, `doctor`, `init`, `list-plugins`, `list-styles`, `install-browser`). Interactive `@clack/prompts` TUI walk-through when no URL is provided in a TTY. 13 typed exit codes.
- **`@ohmyperf/mcp-server`** — MCP server binary `ohmyperf-mcp` exposing 12 tools + 7 prompts for AI coding agents (Claude in OpenCode, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Claude Desktop). Reports persisted at `~/.ohmyperf-mcp/reports/` and exposed as `ohmyperf://reports/<id>.json` resources.
- **`@ohmyperf/core`** — Measurement engine, plugin runtime, pre-flight CPU calibration, Mann-Whitney U non-parametric diff with per-metric noise floors. Schema 1.0.0 frozen.
- **`@ohmyperf/driver-playwright`** — Playwright + CDP driver with `Target.setAutoAttach({ flatten: true })` for OOPIF (cross-origin iframe) deep-inspection. ~99% iframe metric coverage.
- **`@ohmyperf/plugins-builtin`** — Built-in plugin set: `cwvPlugin` (LCP/INP/CLS subpart attribution), `axePlugin` (accessibility), `thirdPartiesPlugin` (third-party-web v0.29.2 vendor classification), `customMetricExamplePlugin`.
- **`@ohmyperf/design-tokens`** — OKLCH-based design tokens + 4 brand systems: `calibre` (default), `linear-app` (dark canvas), `stripe` (light, multi-layer shadows), `vercel` (4-layer shadow + border:none). WCAG-AA contrast gate enforced via `scripts/check-contrast.mjs` in CI.
- **`@ohmyperf/viewer`** — Self-contained single-file HTML viewer. Zero CDN, zero external network requests. Embeds report JSON as `<script type="application/json">`, parsed into `window.__OHMYPERF_REPORT__`.
- **`@ohmyperf/reporter-{json,html,deck,markdown,junit,csv}`** — 6 reporters: canonical JSON (schema source of truth), self-contained HTML, multi-slide deck (⌘P → PDF first-class), PR-comment-friendly Markdown, JUnit XML (one `<testcase>` per budget threshold), long-format CSV.
- **`@ohmyperf/share-client`** — Upload + fetch shareable reports with env-secret redaction before upload. Throws `ShareSecretLeakError` listing leaked env key names if any secret values appear in URLs/headers/query.

### Measurement features

- Real-machine, real Chromium (not synthetic cloud, not Lighthouse's simulated lantern model).
- `Target.setAutoAttach({ flatten: true })` OOPIF auto-attach → per-frame `FrameTree` with `isOOPIF`, `isCrossOrigin`, `isSrcdoc`, `isFenced`, `detachedAt`.
- Pre-flight CPU calibration benchmark (200k Math.sin/cos in browser) normalized to mid-range-2024-laptop reference (250 ms). Cached 24h by machine fingerprint.
- Network: Fast 4G profile (12 Mbps DL / 5 Mbps UL / 70 ms RTT) for `--mode=ci-stable`.
- Mann-Whitney U significance test with per-metric noise floors (TTFB/INP 10%, LCP/FCP/CLS 5%).
- N runs default 5, configurable up to 30.
- LCP/INP/CLS subpart attribution: `MetricAttribution` includes `element`, `url`, `longestScript.{url, invoker, subpart}`, layout-shift `previousRect`/`currentRect`.
- Long-task collection via `PerformanceObserver` + trace-event attribution via vendored `tracium`.

### MCP differentiators (vs `chrome-devtools-mcp`)

- **`track_url`** — longitudinal monitoring with NDJSON time-series at `~/.ohmyperf-mcp/timeseries/<sha256-url>.ndjson` + OLS slope + windowed median trend (improving/stable/regressing + confidence).
- **`find_regression_cause`** — ranked causal-attribution hypotheses (grown resources, new long-tasks, new third-party vendors).
- **`enforce_budget`** — contract-as-code with structured PASS/FAIL + exit-code-style verdict. Defaults: lcp ≤ 2500ms, inp ≤ 200ms, cls ≤ 0.1, tbt ≤ 200ms.

### CI / release infrastructure

- 5 GitHub Actions workflows: `ci.yml` (multi-OS matrix: macOS 13/15, Ubuntu 22.04/24.04, Windows 2022; Node 22.x + 24.x), `dogfood.yml` (weekly self-measurement on perf changes), `website-budgets.yml` (bundle budget gate), `publish-beta.yml` (push to `beta` branch → `@ohmyperf/*@beta`), `publish-stable.yml` (manual workflow_dispatch with conventional-commit semver detection → `@ohmyperf/*@latest`).
- `pnpm@10.33.3` + Turbo monorepo. Apache-2.0 license + NOTICE in every published package.
